(future) personal portfolio page

As many developers, I've been making websites for other people but none for myself. My goal here is to combine my old portfolio (at https://heidimichel.46graus.com/) and my temp portfolio (at https://codepen.io/heidimichel_/pen/OJmZvpO) and create something new, actually useful and improve my skills.
Thank the community for https://pages.github.com/ ! Only tutorial I needed so far :)
